RoboFleet Data Platform - real-time robotic telemetry ingestion using Terraform, GKE, Argo CD, Pub/Sub, BigQuery, and Prometheus/Grafana.
#  RoboFleet Data Platform

A portfolio-grade DevOps/Platform Engineer project simulating a **fleet of delivery robots** streaming telemetry into a **cloud-native data platform** on Google Cloud.  
Built to demonstrate **GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, Argo CD, GitOps, CI/CD, observability, and SRE practices** at scale.

---

## Problem
Robotics and IoT systems generate **bursty, high-volume telemetry** that must be:
- Collected reliably (with backpressure & replay),
- Processed in near real-time,
- Stored for analytics,
- Deployed and operated securely at scale.

---

## Solution
I designed and implemented the **RoboFleet Data Platform**:

- **Robots (simulated)** ‚Üí Python-based telemetry simulator emits JSON events (GPS, battery, status).  
- **Ingestor (FastAPI on GKE)** ‚Üí consumes from **Pub/Sub**, validates data, writes to **BigQuery** (hot) and **GCS** (cold).  
- **Control API (FastAPI on GKE)** ‚Üí manages robot commands (pause/resume).  
- **Infrastructure as Code** ‚Üí Terraform modules for VPC, GKE, Pub/Sub, BigQuery, Secret Manager.  
- **CI/CD & GitOps** ‚Üí GitHub Actions (build + Trivy scan + push) + Argo CD (Helm charts, app-of-apps).  
- **Observability & SRE** ‚Üí Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, SLOs (p95 latency <5s, error rate <0.5%), canary rollouts with auto-rollback.  
- **Security** ‚Üí Workload Identity, Secret Manager CSI, non-root containers, NetworkPolicies.

---

## Outcome
- Ingested telemetry from **1,000 simulated robots @ ~5 events/sec**.  
- Maintained **p95 ingest latency <5s** with horizontal scaling.  
- Achieved **zero plaintext secrets** ‚Äî all credentials managed via GCP Secret Manager CSI + Workload Identity.  
- Canary rollout triggered an **automatic rollback** when error rate >0.5%.  
- Produced Grafana dashboards with live ingest rates, Pub/Sub backlog, BigQuery latency.

This mirrors the type of **real-world reliability and scalability challenges**
